; NAME:
;   LABEL_REGION_SPARSE
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Label regions (connected components) in an arbitrary-dimensional array
;   when the indices of foreground (nonzero) elements are already known, and
;   there are few foreground elements compared to the total size of the array.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   labels = label_region_sparse(array, indices, [/all_neighbors], [ndiff])
;
; INPUTS:
;   ARRAY: the array containing the regions.  This array is not changed at all,
;     but its dimensions are measured to calculate where to look for neighbors.
;  
;   INDICES: an array containing indices to the foreground elements in ARRAY.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;   NDIFF: sets exactly how many dimensions in which a voxel's position must be
;     offset to be considered a neighbor.  For example, in 3D, NDIFF = 1
;     produces face connectivity, NDIFF = 2 produces face and edge, and
;     NDIFF = 3 produces face, edge, and vertex connectivity (26-connectivity).
;
;   ALL_NEIGHBORS: switches on full connectivity: equivalent to setting NDIFF
;     equal to the number of dimensions of the array.  Behavior is exactly the
;     same as in IDL's LABEL_REGION.
;
;   If ALL_NEIGHBORS is set, it will override any setting of NDIFF.
;   If neither keyword is set, the default is NDIFF = 1.
;
; OUTPUT:
;   A vector of ULONGs, the same size as INDICES, containing the region label
;   for each element in INDICES.  The regions are numbered 1..N with no gaps
;   for an N-region image.
